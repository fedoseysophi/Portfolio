As part of academic and project work, I have designed and implemented interactive dashboards for data visualization and analysis, tackling various tasks:

## Business Metrics Reporting Dashboards:
Developed summary dashboards for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), including sales dynamics, inventory levels, campaign effectiveness, and departmental performance.

## User Behavior Analytics:
Created visualizations to analyze sales funnels, segment users by activity, and identify behavioral patterns on websites or products.

## ETL/ELT Process Quality and Stability Monitoring:
Integrated monitoring panels for tracking loading statuses, errors, data anomalies, and processing speeds in real time.

## Data Discovery and Ad-hoc Analytics:
Configured exploratory panels with filters for quick data analysis and insight generation without direct involvement from the development team.
