**Data Engineering Stack and Completed Tasks:**

- **Apache Flink:**  
  Used for building streaming data pipelines, processing event time, executing jobs with checkpoints, aggregating by keys, and extracting metrics from stream data (e.g., tracking clicks and events with timestamps, handling watermarks, saving state to S3).

- **Apache Spark:**  
  Utilized for batch log processing, creating and working with DataFrames, filtering events by error level, aggregating data, calculating statistics, parsing logs from various sources (HiveServer, access.log), and generating reports on website visits and API activity (methods, paths, ranking requests).

- **Python (pandas):**  
  Focused on data preprocessing: loading CSV files, cleaning and transforming data, working with external APIs (e.g., weather), converting data to Parquet format, aggregating and preparing data for further analysis and visualization.

- **Scala:**  
  Developed NLP and REST API services: text data processing, keyword filtering, integration with Smile ML library, building JSON endpoints for automated data handling and filtering.

- **ClickHouse:**  
  Deployed and configured databases using Docker Compose; loaded large aviation datasets, modeled tables, wrote SQL queries for reporting (e.g., flight delays, routes, carriers) and performed aggregation and analysis of raw and processed data.

- **Data Format Handling:**  
  Worked with CSV, Parquet, Avro, and ORC formats. Implemented pipelines for conversion, loading, and validation of time, type, and data structures using Spark, Scala, and Python.

- **n8n:**  
  Set up automatic workflows to integrate data between services, enabling transfer of information from external sources (Google Sheets, APIs, email notifications) to databases and dashboards.

- **Working with Data Orchestrators, Including Apache NiFi:**  
  Managed data flows and visually designed complex integration and processing pipelines via Apache NiFi's interface. Configured transformations, filtering, and routing of streams between various sources and storages.

- **Database Administration and Query Optimization (PostgreSQL):**  
  Administered database instances, developed and optimized SQL queries, and ensured data integrity and performance.

**Technology Stack:**  
Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Python (pandas), Scala (NLP and REST), ClickHouse (via Docker Compose), Apache NiFi, PostgreSQL, data handling in CSV, Parquet, Avro, ORC formats, n8n, Docker, DBeaver.

**Scope of Work:**  
Developed and deployed ETL/ELT pipelines, automated data collection and processing, built analytics and reporting pipelines for business metrics and events, configured service integration and monitoring, ensured high-quality aggregation and storage of large data volumes, and supported analytics automation via workflow tools.
